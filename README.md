# Dynamic Adaptation Model (DAM)

Climate Resilience and National Resilience programs are focusing to formulate the Bangladesh National Adaptation Plan (NAP) for long-term adaptation investments and enhance national capacity for integration of climate change adaptation (CCA) in planning, budgeting, and financial tracking process. However, these programs and projects need a system-level quantitative model to assess the requirement for adaptations are different scales and consequently decide on adaptation financing to these programs and projects. The present project is built on the earlier findings of the DECCMA project to address the above issues, with the  target to add the necessary refinement through incorporating the equity, accessibility, adequacy, and gender dimensions so that it can be useful at different scale of adaptation for climate change. The Dynamic Adaptation Model (DAM) is the product which has been developed gradually and can be applied at different scales that can support the different communities, sectorial agencies/departments to guide local and national planning to adaptations while prioritizing in selecting appropriate options in different programs and projects to ensure the efficient use of available resources. DAM is developed based on strong mathematical formulation supported by field evidence. The model is calibrated and validated using field data to quantify the present-day adaption need and now is being tested for some of the proposed adaptation in the NAP processes to assess its usefulness at the national level.  Moreover, it is the home-grown model, therefore, the required customized version for different communities, agencies are possible through updates in the future with its extension for new areal coverage in collaboration with the developers and the alignment of the recent national initiatives. These are the ongoing processes essential to make it useful for the mainstream national adaptation plan that need further work.
